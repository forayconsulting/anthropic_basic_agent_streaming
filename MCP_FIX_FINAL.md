# MCP Connection Fix - Final Solution

## Problem Summary
The MCP connection was showing "Connected successfully!" but reporting "No tools or resources available" because:

1. The GitHub MCP server was starting (`GitHub MCP Server running on stdio`)
2. But the MCP client wasn't properly communicating with it
3. The issue was architectural - the current implementation tried to maintain a persistent background connection, but the MCP SDK expects to be used within context managers

## Root Cause
The MCP SDK's `stdio_client` is designed to be used as a context manager that maintains the process lifecycle. The original implementation tried to keep this connection alive in a background task, which doesn't work properly with how the GitHub MCP server expects to communicate.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `MCPSessionManager` 
A new session manager that:
- Tests the connection when initialized
- Caches available tools and resources
- Creates fresh connections for each tool call
- Properly uses context managers as the MCP SDK expects

### 2. Created `ClaudeAgentV2`
An updated agent that uses the session manager instead of trying to maintain a persistent connection.

### 3. Updated Chat Server
Modified to use the new V2 agent with the fixed MCP implementation.

## How It Works Now

1. **Connection Phase**: When you connect, it:
   - Creates a temporary connection to the MCP server
   - Fetches and caches available tools/resources
   - Closes the connection cleanly

2. **Usage Phase**: When tools are needed:
   - Creates a fresh connection
   - Executes the tool
   - Closes the connection

This matches how the MCP SDK is designed to work.

## Testing the Fix

1. **Restart your chat server**:
   ```bash
   python3 chat_server.py
   ```

2. **Connect using one of these formats**:
   
   **Environment variable prefix**:
   ```
   GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_github_token_here npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
   ```
   
   **JSON format**:
   ```json
   {"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"], "env": {"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_github_token_here"}}
   ```

3. **Watch the server logs** - you should now see:
   - "MCP: Testing connection..."
   - "MCP: Connection successful - X tools, Y resources"
   - Specific tool names being discovered

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Reliability**: Uses MCP SDK as designed
2. **Compatibility**: Works with all MCP servers that follow the protocol
3. **Debugging**: Clear logging shows exactly what's happening
4. **Performance**: Caches capabilities to avoid repeated queries

## If Issues Persist

1. Check the server logs for detailed MCP debug output
2. Try with a simpler MCP server first: `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /Users`
3. Ensure npx has internet access to download packages
4. Clear npx cache if needed: `npm cache clean --force`

The fix properly handles the MCP protocol's connection lifecycle and should work with any compliant MCP server.
